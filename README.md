Supervised Machine Learning - Regression & Classification

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying Supervised Machine Learning techniques, specifically Regression and Classification, to analyze a dataset. The goal is to choose a suitable dataset, preprocess it, apply three different models, and determine the best performing one for real-world application. The project is implemented in Python and involves data preparation, feature selection, model evaluation, and optimization.

🚀 Features

Selection and preprocessing of a dataset with at least 15 variables.

Implementation of three supervised learning models (Regression/Classification).

Model performance evaluation and optimization.

Comparison of models to determine the most effective one.

Critical analysis of the approach and results.

🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x

Required Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

A dataset with at least 15 variables (including dependent and independent variables).
