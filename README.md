# Supervised Machine Learning - Regression & Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on applying **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques, specifically **Regression and Classification**, to analyze a dataset. The goal is to choose a suitable dataset, preprocess it, apply three different models, and determine the best performing one for real-world application. The project is implemented in **Python** and involves **data preparation, feature selection, model evaluation, and optimization**.

## 🚀 Features
- Selection and preprocessing of a dataset with at least **15 variables**.
- Implementation of **three supervised learning models** (Regression/Classification).
- Model performance evaluation and optimization.
- Comparison of models to determine the most effective one.
- Critical analysis of the approach and results.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
- A dataset with at least **15 variables** (including dependent and independent variables).

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression models.
- **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score** for classification models.
- **Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve** for model comparisons.

## 👥 Team Contribution
Each team member must clearly indicate their contribution and learning reflection in the final report.

## 📢 Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience in **supervised learning**, covering all aspects from **data selection to model evaluation**. The critical analysis in the final report and presentation will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
